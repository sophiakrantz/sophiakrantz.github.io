    <p id="subtitle">Welcome to the world of Jewish online culture and humor! This page will shed some light on how Jewish culture has developed over time.</p>
    <p id="paragraph">
      The Jewish people are descended from the Hebrew people, a monotheistic religious group comprised of twelve tribes:  Reuven (ראובן), Shimon (שמון), Levi (לוי), Yehuda (יהודה), Dan (דן), Naftali (נפתלי), Gad (גד), Asher (אשר), Yizachar (יזכר), Zevulun (זבולון), Yosef (יוסף), and Binyamin (בנימין). These tribes settled in the Middle East in Israel around the 10th century BCE and were forced into the Diaspora around the 7th century BCE, resulting in the Hebrew people spreading out from their home, many of the tribes lost to history through intermarriage, conversion, and death. The tribes still known to be existing today are Levi, Binyamin, and Yehuda, with the term “Jewish” or “Jew” derived from the name “Yehuda” itself.
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph">
      As the Hebrew people intermarried and assimilated into the countries they were exiled to (and occasionally flourished in), they adopted the ethnicities they settled into and integrated them into their identity. Among modern-day Jewish people multiple cultural identities exist but the following groups are broad categories of these:
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph">
      <b>Ashkenaz</b> (or Ashkenazi)--Jewry of Eastern European and North Asian descent. Ashkenaz Jews make up approximately 80% of Jews worldwide and have the widest range of religious denominations in the Jewish faith. Yiddish (a language blend of Hebrew, German, Slavic, and Aramaic) is often spoked or recognized as a second language in Ashkenaz homes, and Ashkenaz religious observances follow Rabbi Moses Isserles's interpretation of Jewish law. Common foods include matzoh ball soup, brisket, and chulent.
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph">
      <b>Sephardic</b> (or Sephardi)--Jewry of Spanish and Portugese descent prior to expulsion into the Ottoman Empire and South America. There are no defined religious denominations within the Sephardic community since they tend to focus on their community ties to one another and their spiritual connection with G-d than strict observances. Ladino (a language blend of Hebrew and Spanish) is a second language in Sephardic culture but is not commonly spoken, and Sephardic religious observances follow Rabbi Joseph Caro's interpretation of Jewish law. Common foods include mufletta and chamin.
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph">
      <b>Mizrahi</b>--Jewry of Middle Eastern and North African descent. Similar to Sephardim, Mizrahim do not have religious denominations and are more open and spiritual than strict. Judeo-Arabic (a language blend of Hebrew and local Arabic dialects) was traditionally spoken as a second language in Mizrahi homes. Common food include laffa, baklawa, and schug.
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph">
      <b>Yemenite</b> (or Taimani)--Mizrahi Jewry of Yemen descent. Similar to Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews, Yemenites do not have any religious denominations, and prayer services emphasize spoken hymns as a tradition based in making prayer accessible to anyone whether literate or not. Common foods include lachuch, malawach, and Hawaij soups.
