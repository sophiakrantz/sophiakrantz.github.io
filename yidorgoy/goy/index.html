      <h3>Welcome to the world of Jewish online culture and humor! This page will shed some light on how Jewish culture has developed over time.</h3>

      <h4>The Jewish people are descended from the Hebrew people, a religious group following the monotheistic Jewish faith and comprised of twelve tribes: Reuven (ראובן), Shimon (שמון), Levi (לוי), Yehuda (יהודה), Dan (דן), Naftali (נפתלי), Gad (גד), Asher (אשר), Yizachar (יזכר), Zevulun (זבולון), Yosef (יוסף), and Binyamin (בנימין). These tribes settled in the Middle East in Israel around the 10th century BCE and were forced into the Diaspora around the 7th century BCE, resulting in the Hebrew people spreading out from their home, many of the tribes lost to history through intermarriage, conversion, and death. The tribes still known to be existing today are Levi, Binyamin, and Yehuda, with the term “Jewish” or “Jew” derived from the name “Yehuda” itself.</h4>

      <h4>As the Hebrew people intermarried and assimilated into the countries they were exiled to (and occasionally flourished in), they adopted the ethnicities they settled into and integrated them into their identity. Within the modern day Jewish people multiple cultural identities exist, such as:</h4>

      <h4><b>Ashkenaz</b> (or Ashkenazi)--Jewry of European (and north Asian) descent. Ashkenaz Jews are largely Caucasian and bear a history of shtetls (small, Jewish villages) and money-lending during the Middle Ages. Yiddish (a language blend of Hebrew, German, Slavic languages, and Aramaic languages) is often spoken or recognized as a second language in Ashkenazi homes, and common foods include matzah balls, gefilte fish, and chulent. Ashkenaz traditions and rules follow traditional Jewish rituals and interpretations of Jewish law, influencing both their prayer services and holiday observances.</h4>

      <h4><b>Sephardic</b> (or Sephardi)--Jewry of Spanish or Portugese descent. Sephardic Jewry heavily integrated into Moorish Spain during the Middle Ages and saw prosperity as political figures and traders. Ladino (a language blend of Hebrew and Spanish) is often spoken or recognized as a second language in Sephardi homes, and common foods include adafina, cozido, and boyoz. Sephardic traditions and rules follow (?) Jewish ritural and interpretations of Jewish law, influencing both their prayer services and holiday observances.</h4>

      <h4><b>Mizrah</b> (or Mizrahi)--Jewry of Middle Eastern or Central Asian descent</h4>

      <h4><b>Yemenite</b> (or Teimaini)--Jewry of Yemen descent</h4>

      <h4><b>Karaite</b>--Jewry of Egyptian, Iraqi, or Crimean descent</h4>

      <h4><b>Syrian</b>--Jewry of Syrian descent</h4>

      <h4><b>Persian</b>--Jewry of Persian descent</h4>
