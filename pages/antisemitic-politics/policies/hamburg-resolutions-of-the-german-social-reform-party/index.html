    <p>1. It is the task of the antisemitic party ever to deepen and spread knowledge of the true essence of the Jewish race. We stand only at the beginning of this activity.</p>
    <p>2. The strivings of Zionism are a fruit of the antisemitic movement. It acknowledges the so-often-denied national cohesiveness of all Jews. The constitutional strivings of the Zionists merit support only if they give the guarantee that all Jews will be drawn to Zion. Unfortunately that appears to be infeasible. It is intolerable that the Alliance israélite [universelle] should become a sovereign power and that it should maintain an ambassador at the German imperial court.</p>
    <p>3. Thanks to the development of our modern means of communication, the Jewish question ought to be permitted to become a world question in the course of the twentieth century. As such, it should be solved in common with other nations and result finally in full separation, and- if self-defense demands—in final annihilation [Vernichtung] of the Jewish race. The "true" peace conference will be the one in which the peoples of the globe occupy themselves with the position of the Hebrews. Until then, however, it will be the affair of every individual nation to defend itself against the Jewish plague as best it can.</p>
    <p>4. One of the first steps for legislative intervention against the Jewish race must be the legal definition of who shall be considered a Jew. It is racial descent and this alone that determines membership in Jewry. The party congress (of the German Social Reform party) welcomes the draft of a Jewish registration law, published in the summer of 1898, as preparation for the solution of this basic task.</p>
    <p>5. Point 19 of the party program calls for a statistical census of Jews. It is necessary that this census embraces all facets of Jewish life in Germany so that comparisons to the total population can be made.</p>
    <p>6. The congress recommends to the Reichstag factions [of the party] that it make suitable motions in the Reichstag every year in order to compel the individual representatives and other parties to take a stand on the Jewish question</p>
