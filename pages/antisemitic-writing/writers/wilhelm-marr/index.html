    <p><span class="hide">Whenever circumstances cause me to use controversial speech, this can and must be understood as a “scream of pain” coming from the oppressed.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Resigned pessimism flows from my pen.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Just think: "</span>there always will be<span class="hide"> queer characters such as this one", but rest assured that nobody will be happier than I, should the facts which I shall touch upon, be shown to be </span>untrue<span class="hide">.</p>
    <p><span class="hide">I shall announce, loudly and without any attempt to be ironic, that Judaism has triumphed on a worldwide historical </span>basis<span class="hide">. I shall bring the news of a lost battle and of the victory of the enemy and all of that I shall do without offering excuses </span>for<span class="hide"> the defeated army.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">When one people conquers another, one of the following two things may happen. First it may be that the conquerer merges into the culture of the conquered and thus loses his identity.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">An entire Semitic tribe is repeatedly and forcibly taken away from its native country Palestine, led into captivity and finally “dispersed”.Those who were taken into “Babylonian captivity” were let go, since the Babylonians seemingly soon tired of their Judaic captives. The majority returned to Palestine. The “bankers” and the wealthy stayed in Babylon in spite of the ire and wrath of the elder </span>Jewish<span class="hide"> prophets.We now must point to the fact, that Jews from the very beginning, wherever they appear in history, were </span>hate<span class="hide">d </span>by all people<span class="hide"> and that without exception.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">This was not a consequence of their religion, because the Jews of antiquity, at least from what their prophets tell, knew perfectly well how to join in the idolatry of other people, while “rigid Judaism” developed only during the time after the destruction of Jerusalem.</span></p>
    <p></span class>The universal hostility against Jews<span class="hide"> had different roots. First </span>is<span class="hide"> the loathing Jews demonstrate for real work, second their codified enmity against </span>all<span class="hide"> non-Jews.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Anybody who has gone to the trouble to even superficially study the Mosaic law of the Bible will admit that a people adhering in war and peace to the codex of Moses will find it hard to elicit international sympathy. The relationship between Jews and Jehovah was unimaginative, calloused, purely contractual, businesslike and rigidly formalistic. In everyday life the most practical realism imaginable prevailed and was of brazen solidity. Even the Jehovah of the Old Testament was a rigid realist. He acknowledged the existence of “other deities” and was </span>motivated by<span class="hide"> his </span>hate for<span class="hide"> them.</p>
    <p><span class="hide">The Roman world of the day as well as all of classical antiquity was in the throes of disintegration at the time the Jews were imported. Semitism therefore encountered fertile ground for its realistic approach and already in Constantine’s days the “new-Jews” (Christians) were the power behind the money.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">All the nations of antiquity, including the trading Phoenicians and Carthaginians, did not think well of engaging in, what we now call agiotage, profiteering and usury. If in the Middle Ages we encounter a “Mr. Moneybag” he was a Jew. Jews were made use of but despised. This attitude is similar to its modern form, in which traitors are met with contempt while their treason may be welcome.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">The abstract realism of Judaism had thus been forcibly imported into western society by the Romans. Times and circumstances proved favorable for Judaism’s development and proliferation. Judaism had turned into the realistic helper in history and encountered a more fertile ground for its indolent and speculative realism in the West than it ever possessed in Palestine.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Nothing is more natural than the hatred the Jews must have felt for those who </span>enslaved<span class="hide"> them </span>and abducted<span class="hide"> them from their homeland. Nothing is more natural than that this hatred had to grow during the course of oppression and persecution in the Occident over the span of almost two thousand years. Nothing was more natural than the Jews becoming even more spiteful during their banishment and quasi-captivity than they had been in the Orient. Nothing is more natural than that they responded using their inborn gifts of craftiness and cleverness by forming as “captives” a state within a state, a society within a society. The Jewish “state within a state” used guile to continue its war in the Occident, while it had used deadly weapons against the peoples in the Orient, where it had been the stronger party.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">This simply was a natural right for the Jews. One must not expect humility instead of defiance from the suppressed and certainly can’t expect meekness from a </span>people whose traditions do not know<span class="hide"> how to turn the other cheek.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">“</span>An eye for an eye<span class="hide">, a tooth for a tooth”, says Jehovism. If the practice of strict martial law against such a people was justified after the great political err</span>or<span class="hide"> had been made </span>to<span class="hide"> forcibly introduce it into occidental society, then the tough resistance offered by the Jews was equally justified. By the 19th century the amazing toughness and endurance of the Semites had made them the leading power within occidental society. As a result, and that particularly in Germany, Jewry has not been assimilated into Germanism, but Germanism has </span>be<span class="hide">en </span>absorbed into<span class="hide"> Judaism. This development advanced to such an extent that the leading voices of German patriotism, of the “Reichsfreundlichkeit”, in our parliamentary and even religious strife -- are those of the Jews.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Right at the start of the Jewish dispersion into </span>the Occident<span class="hide"> a remarkable historical-cultural event occurred: the Jews established themselves in the cities and showed themselves even less desiring to engage in agriculture and colonization than they had shown in Palestine and earlier in Egypt. One must not argue that in some countries Jews might have been prohibited from acquiring land and property. Until deep into the Middle Ages the Occident comprised much uncultivated land. There was no reason to not “squat” on land and to lead a life such as had been led by the cultural pioneers in the woods of North America. Then there was abundant unclaimed land in the Occident. It was however not claimed by the Jews, because they lacked the vigor of the old Anglo-Saxons, who, expelled on account of their faith, created states out of the wilderness in the Far West. It was not axe and plough, but the tricks and the crafts of the practical spirit of hagglers which were the weapons with which the Jews conquered the Occident and created a New Palestine particularly in Germany.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">And, why in Germany of all places?</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Romanism, the old Caesarean Rome, had itself turned towards political-cultural realism to such a degree, that the Jews faced a political entity, which could only be fragmented by the idealism of Christianity. With the introduction of the latter as the state religion, with the beginning of the papacy, which had to maintain the juxtaposition of Christ and non-Christ in order to monopolize the world, the Jewish freedom of action in Rome and in Italy found itself to be limited. Jewry dispersed increasingly and retreated before the religionist Christian fanaticism. It diffused en masse to Spain and Portugal and into the Slavic countries, and then emigrated from there in large numbers by way of Holland into Germany, all the while able to continue with less hindrance in its socially undermining activity among the Slavic barbarians. Next to Slavism, Germanism was least prepared to face foreigners. A sense of German nationality, not to speak of German national pride, did not exist in German lands. And it was exactly for this reason that Judaism found it easier to extend its roots in Germany than in other places.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">But even here the special character of the foreigners from the Orient caused offense. Within the agricultural Germanic lands the Semitic craftiness and its practical business sense provoked a reaction against the Jews. This foreign tribe and its opportunism contrasted too much with the basic character of Germanism. Its rules, its articles of belief which allowed to view all non-Jews as “unclean” * ), provoked anger among the people, while on the other hand the Jews permitted themselves to be used by nobility in financial transactions carried out at the expense of the people.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Highly gifted, with great flair for activities like these, the Jews dominated retail and wholesale trade as early as the Middle Ages and outwitted the hard working common folk.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">The common people realized that their own sense of ethics was not shared by the Jews, because these, rather than striving for emancipation preferred to accumulate wealth. Where such accumulation was involved they were ready to tolerate suffering. Openly suppressed from above, they were able to take advantage of those below. The common folk had no chance to grumble about being exploited by their nobles, an activity in which the Jews acted as brokers. For this reason the people used religion as pretext. “The crucifiers of Christ are to exploit us?” they cried. “Hepp! Hepp!”.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">For those at the top of society these occasional persecutions of Jews were not unwelcome. They had the effect of keeping the Jews dependent, willing to continue as brokers and not to think of demanding emancipation for their people as brokerage fee.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">There is no way to deny, that the abstract, money-oriented, haggling mind of the Jews has contributed much to the flourishing of commerce and industry in Germany. It is profits and not ideals which build a state and if we liken profit to a person, then the means to an end are rarely pure and noble. Despotic princes in constant struggle with a despotic and predatory nobility, farmers which barely differed from black slaves except by the color of their skin, a middle class which deep into the time of the crusades was poorly developed and lacked self-assurance, that is what German society was like, while in Italy, France and Spain culture flourished.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Into this confused, clumsy Germanic element penetrated a smooth, crafty, pliable Jewry ; with all of its gifts of realism, intellectually well qualified as far as the gift of astuteness is concerned, to look down upon the Germans and subduing the monarchical, knightly, lumbering German by enabling him in his vices.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">The Jew had no homeland. With each passing day he became more estranged from his former native land and memories of it became merely symbolic. Nature had denied him the gift to blend with other people, to assimilate. He continued to reject their religion, and resisted their customs, traditions and way of life. He was able to deceive his oppressors in everything, but not in his desire to be a Jew and to remain one. His charter was a lasting challenge of and manifestation against the “unclean” among whom he lived. He was a typical foreigner to them and remained one until today; and yes, his exclusive Judaism, as we shall demonstrate in what follows, shows itself even more today after his emancipation, than it did in earlier times.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">We must therefore not be embarassed to admit that right “ab ovo” (from the very beginning) an element had entered our Occidental society which surpassed our ancestors by far in guile and astuteness and fought with these weapons in the Occident, after the fire and sword of fanaticism and hatred against other people in the Orient had been wrenched from its hands. Ever since, Jewry has, using these weapons, continued its struggle in the Occident against all that is not Jewish. It successfully resisted our own ideology and inoculated us from year to year with more of its own by making the line separating right from wrong so elastic, that in the spheres of trade and exchange the border is now found where brutal crime has its beginning and non-sanctioned crime has been turned into habitual practice. The mischievous remark that stock exchange brokers can be divided into “white” and “black” Jews has a ring of truth to it.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">All of this demonstrates merely that Germanism did not possess sufficient spiritual endurance to protect itself from Judaization and so Germany turned step by step into the new promised land for Semites which came flooding here from Spain, Portugal and Poland to augment the already resident Jewry.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">This tribe, the Jews, possessed throughout its history by a theocratic fervor not found among any other people and whose theocratic code of behavior in war and peace was dreadful, transformed all of its destructive potential into new forms and using these, vanquished the Occident, a victory it could not achieve in the Orient using fire and sword. Such a historical-cultural event is not a bubble which can be burst with a cheap “Hepp, Hepp”.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Such an event is of demonic appearance, in spite of the “grotesque mask” it may show. This tribe, which drew laughter in Caesarean Rome, spread covered with filth heavier than one can see on them today in Russia and Poland, all over Europe. This tribe teased by the educated, abused by the mob and persecuted by religious zealots, these people became “brokers” to the rulers and exacted tribute as early as the Middle Ages. Using the intelligence and flexibility with which it conducted its practical business it exploited the masses, all the while maintaining its theocratic-jehovistic rigidity and fanatically persecuting its own, humanely thinking but unconventional Jews. And so these people conquered the world with their Jewish soul!</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">This is not the power of the Jewish religious faith. The Jew has no real religion, he has a business contract with Jehovah and pays his god with statutes and formulations and in return is charged with the pleasant task of exterminating all that is not Jewish. It is the powerful expression of a conscious, characteristic realism which we must admit exists in Judaism and which we encounter in its pathos and its satire. As far as the actual modalities of business and trade are concerned, we Germans hardly differ any more from the Jews; what we don’t have is the drive of the Semitic people. On account of our tribal organization we shall never be able to acquire such a drive and because cultural development knows no pause, our outlook is none other than a time when we Germans will live as slaves under the legal and political feudalism of Judaism.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">The daily press is predominantly in Jewish hands, which have transformed journalism into an object of speculation and industrial production, into a business with public opinion; critique of theater, of art in general--is to three quarters in the hands of Jews. Writing about politics and even religion is--in Jewish hands.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Let us think about it for a moment.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">After Jewish hustle and bustle had reduced journalism to a trivial but commercially successful enterprise directed at the mob’s liking of gossip and scandal, it had found the largest possible audience for its attempts at Judaizing. Centuries of a factual predominance of Jewish realism had done its preparatory work. Jewry dictated public opinion in the press.But let us now look at the non plus ultra of arrogance of the Jewish victor!</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">The “culture struggle” had begun. While we Germans had been banned and outlawed by the press since 1848 if we considered as much as criticism of anything Jewish, Jewry now involved itself in our religious and cultural struggles with Ultramontanism and, it is hard to believe, even did all the talking. While Jewry searched anxiously to find for its satirical journals anything which they might ridicule as a “Jewish witch-hunt”, it unleashed its torrents upon Ultramontanism--Well! The latter opposed Judaism in the battle for world domination! Here one may certainly not speak of Judaic tactfulness, which in turn demands from us that we treat it like delicate glass or like a Mimosa pudica.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">And indeed, there were important newspapers, in which we Germans were not even permitted to write about the “culture struggle” because--because we, in order to criticize the Roman fanaticism had called it an emanation of the Jehovistic fervor of the Old Testament. In books (such as by Johannes Scherr) on the other hand Jewry could not stand in the way of such political-cultural deductions and analyses; but in its newspapers it even suppressed publications hostile to Ultramontanism, if Israel was touched upon ever so slightly!!</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Just try to comment upon Jewish rituals and statutes. You will find that not even the Pope is more infallible and unimpeachable. To comment upon their rituals is “hatred”, but if the Jew takes it upon himself to pronounce the last word in our religious and state affairs, then it is quite a different matter.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Jewry is already calling “Vae Victis”, while we are in the midst of our religious and political disputes.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">At the beginning of the cultural struggle, I and several of my friends attempted to take part in it by expressing views from a sophisticated, historical-cultural point of view. In vain. We were only allowed to be heard, provided we renounced the use of basic state ments of fact and if we were, ex abrupto, willing to be abusive of “clerics”. Not even under letters to the editor did we enjoy hospitality in the Jewish press, even there, where there might have been an opportunity to express opinions contrary to ours. And this is the way Jewry has--monopolized--free expression of opinion in the press.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">It would be easy to hide our own impotence under cover of an abundant verbiage of Jew hatred. We Germans have officially resigned in favor of Judaism in 1848. Check for yourself: in all aspects of life the way to one’s goal is subject to Jewish mediation. There is no “struggle for existence” without Jewry collecting its commission. Ask yourself, reader, whether I exaggerate!</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">This is the result of the Thirty Years war which Jewry has officially staged against us since 1848 and which does not even offer us the hope for a poor “Westphalian Peace”.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">There is no standing still. It is forward or back!</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Are there any signs that the Jewish twilight of gods is about to close in?</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">No, there are none.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">The social and political dominance of Jewry as well as its religious and ecclesiastic paternalism are still full of youthful vigor and ready to achieve the Jehovist promise (“I shall deliver all the nations to thee, etc”).</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">A sudden reversal is impossible if only for the reason that the entire social structure, formed by Judaization, would collapse and no concept exists to take its place and turn it into reality.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Neither can we look to the “Christian” state for assistance. For the Jews are the “most perfect” citizens of this modern Christian state, which in turn perfectly matches their interests. They are--and this is said without a hint of irony--the best and truest “Reichsfreunde” (Friends of the German Reich), because this Reich is quite ready to advance them to the highest office in the land.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">May I direct a plea to my readers: please save this pamphlet of mine and provide in your will that it be passed from generation to generation.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">It is not a pretentious prophecy of mine, but a statement of my deepest conviction that within less than four generations there will not be a single office in the land, including the highest, which will not have been usurped by the Jews.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Yes, through Jewry Germany will become a world power, an Occidental Palestine.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Not through violent revolutions, but by the voice of the people itself, just as soon as German society will have reached the apogee of social bankruptcy, the apogee of helplessness towards which we are drifting.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Let us not reproach the Jews on this account.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Jewry has fought the Occident for 1800 years. It has conquered and subjected it. We are the vanquished and it is quite in order that the victor chants “Vae Victis!”.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Our Germanic element has shown itself to be impotent, to be power-less vis-a-vis foreign domination in a historical-cultural context. This is a fact, a bitter, inexorable fact. The state, the church, Catholicism, Protes-tantism, credo and dogma, must bow before Jewish judgment in the daily press.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">But this by far, is not all.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">After Germanism, until then a straggler in the Jewish question, had stepped up front to head it, there was no longer any stopping.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Simon and Crémieux were the dictators in France in 1870-1871 during the war and daily drove thousands upon thousands of Frenchmen needlessly to death. After Sedan everybody believed peace would come. Not so! Bismarck would have been able to handle the phraseology of a Jules Favre, but the frivolous, miserable fanaticism of action of the semitic gentlemen in Tours required more “Blood and Iron”.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Poor, Judaized France.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">In England, a German hater, the Semite d’Israeli comme il faut, (as is proper) keeps the question of war and peace in his “waistcoat pocket”.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Who really gained at the Congress of Berlin from the blood shed in the Orient? Jewry did. The “Association israélite” was first in line. Rumania was coerced to officially open floodgates to the corrosive influence of Semitism. As far as Russia is concerned Jewry did not yet dare to make the same demand. This is yet to come.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">And in Germany, who carried off the prize of raw, material advantage? Jewry, represented by a handful of Jewish bankers; Semitic brokers. We Germans got the abstract, imaginary result--to be “Friends of the Reich”, to console us with the “Reich of dreams”.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Who headed in numerically overwhelming fashion the horrid, socially destructive “Gründerthum” after the war? Jewry did.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Stop! Dear reader, don’t gnash your teeth in anger. You have no right to. Foreign rule has been thrust upon us. 1800 years lasted the battle against Jewish domination, which hardly ever strayed from its biblical tradition. The Semitic people suffered unspeakably. You have abused it rudely, but rarely did you fight it spiritually. Starting from modest beginnings, it outgrew you, it corrupted society in all of its aspects, squeezed all idealism out of it, occupies the most controlling influence in trade and daily life, penetrates ever more into public office, controls the theater, forms a social-political front and has left almost nothing for you, except raw labor which it itself has always shunned; it has transformed talent into shiny virtuosity, pimpish advertising into the goddess of public opinion and--rules you today.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Or should Jewry not take advantage of its victory and triumph?</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">The German people could--because it had received permission from ‘Above’ get rid of French foreign rule 1813--1814. Why has French domination not understood how to have its interests taken to heart by ‘Above’ like Jewish domination has understood to accomplish this for itself?</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Of course, high minded individuals such as Schill, Dörnberg, Stein had been ostracized by Germanic monarchs, just as we might be ostracized for merely ascertaining the facts regarding Judaization.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Are we willing to sacrifice? Did we succeed in creating even a single, anti-Jewish leaning paper, which manages to be politically neutral?--Are not even our homemakers and similar associations under patronage of Jewesses, who combine the agreeable with the profitable and corner a little business on the side? Isn’t every nook and cranny of our life subject to the flood of Judaism?</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">You rest yourself on Germanic bearhide. I marvel in admiration at this Semitic people which put its heel onto the nape of our necks. I gather the last remnant of my strength to die as peacefully as possible in Jewish bondage, but as one who has not surrendered and is not willing to ask for pardon.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Can we deny historical facts?</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">We can’t!</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">The historical fact that Judaism has become the leading political-social great power of the 19th century is clearly before our eyes. To de-Judaize ourselves, for that we clearly lack physical and spiritual strength. The raw, brute force but completely subconscious protest against the actual Judaization was Social Democracy, which--acted with and for the Jews, because Jewry had infiltrated its ranks as well. Just as the founder of German Social Democracy, Lasalle, had been a Semite himself.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Why, therefore, should we now be surprised? We harbor a resilient, tough, intelligent, foreign tribe among us, who knows how to take advantage of every form of abstract reality. It is not the individual Jew, it is Jewish spirit and Jewish awareness which have taken over the world. No longer can we speak of a persecution of Jews, when the howls of German persecution may be heard as soon as a non-Jew dares to rear his head.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">These are all historical-cultural facts, so unique in their aspects, so awesome, that it is impossible to dispute them using everyday polemics. The proud Roman Empire has not been able to win such triumphs with all the might of its arms, as has typical Semitism won in the Occident and particularly in Germany.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Among all the European states only Russia is left to still resist the frank foreign invasion. The most recent example of coming action against this last bulwark was set by Jewry in the case of Rumania. As current events and cirumstances indicate the final surrender of Russia is only a question of time.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">In this multifaceted, huge state Jewry will find the cardinal point which it needs, to completely unhinge the Western world.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Jewish, resilient, fly-by-night attitude will plunge Russia into a revolution like the world might never have seen before. Social nihilism and abstract individualism will be conjured up in such a way, that the only half civilized Czarist Empire will be unable to resist. The underdeveloped, still in swaddling clothes living or already under Jewish influence corrupted administration will offer a suitable handle. Just look at the multinational Austria to see how solidly and irreversibly she is in Jewish hands today!!</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">How and where might these partially primitive national elements in Russia be more resistant than we Germans are and were, when the exemplary well administrated and stalwart Prussia with its honest and modest Hohenzollern, with its disciplined population has already been breached by Jewry.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Are we not witnessing today that under the gentle and humane Czar Alexander, who has abolished serfdom, it is--nihilism which flourishes?!</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">And Russia is to offer resistance against the social nihilism which Jewry has imported into the Occident?--</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">This is impossible!</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">With Russia, Jewry will have captured the last strategic position from which it has to fear a possible attack on its rear, but once it has paralyzed Russia, its rear will be perfectly secure. After it has invaded Russia’s offices and agencies the same way it did ours, then the collapse of our Western society will begin in earnest openly and in Jewish fashion. The “last hour” of doomed Europa will strike at the latest in 100 to 150 years, since events develop more rapidly now, than they did in past centuries.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">What Russia may expect from Judaism is clear. With exception of two or three platonically neutral Jewish papers, the entire Jewish daily press has frenziedly taken the side of Asia against Russia in the Russian-Turkish war27. Neither the religious aspect of this war--as secondary in importance as it may have been--nor--and this is the important point--the historical-cultural idea, which stands above all diplomacy, the memory of the centuries, even millenniums of struggle against Asia--not even the hellenistic tradition, were able to convince the Jewish press to a adopt a more sophisticated attitude.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Certainly! This press would have stood beside Russia, if a Lasker28 or Bamberger29 had played politically the first fiddle on the shores of the river Neva or if Jewry had financially been even more important in Russia than in Turkey. But instead, a howling self-interest emerged from every anti-Russian newspaper article.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Á la guerre come á la guerre (one must take things as they come)! It was a right for the Jews, because they are aliens and had been forced to wage war against us, and with that I only state a fact--sine ira et studio--“Which side should I be on?” was and can be heard whenever Jews consider partisanship; they are more “toujours en vedette” (always on the lookout) than the entire Occident is.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Just as we fared in the question of the “culture struggle”, we also fared in the Oriental question. Any opinion deviating from the Judaic position found no space in the Jewish dailies, which had almost completely taken sides for Jewish industrial interests. In the German press earnestness and satire blindly took the side of a disintegrating, financially in Jewish clutches languishing Turkey. Securities speculation determined what public opinion should be.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">In addition, Russia stumbled into the war without any spiritual preparation, without having sought even a shadow of public opinion for herself and allowed the idea to take hold, that she was driven by a titillating desire for conquest and not by its mission in the Orient. The thought that implicitly the insolence of the great sea power England might be curbed and that stating this idea would have yielded many friends for Russia, was never expressed and so--England became the ally of Judaism.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">It has always been a misfortune for the Slavs that they ignored the spirit of Germanism and judged it solely on the basis of Jewish newspaper reports. Good God, the German spirit is about to become a stranger even in the German press. It will not even be ten years and one will not be able to find a single journalist in all of Germany who has not been circumcised! At most, clerks for hire will be found rendering service in the industry of the Jewish press.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">And even that will be quite in order, because “á la guerre comme á la guerre” and prisoners of war must “dig trenches”.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">I am not entitled to and this is hardly the place to criticize the interior policies of Count Bismarck since 1866. Suffice it to say, that since then, His Honor, the Count, is worshipped by Jewry like Constantine and that the national, liberal Jewish “opposition” quite openly pushes for power which the Count should grant it presently. I can’t say that this Jewish expectation is ridiculous; the foundation of our interior politics have, since the war with Austria and even more so since the war with France been such, that the boldest Jewish aspirations can’t be considered ridiculous.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">How come! France had within the last 7 years one Jewish dictator and one Jewish triumvirate--England one Jewish premier, and Germany, the social El Dorado of Jewry should not be capable to swim with the current?--It would be rather laughable should Jewry reduce its expectations by even half a tone.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">If I as a German and one of the vanquished am not to criticize the interior policies of Count Bismarck, then I would if I were a Jew say: “The Count understands his era as no other statesman before him. He has the clear historical-cultural insight that Germanism is bankrupt and in its last gasps and he is casting about for elements with more vitality”.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">How can men be of use to him, men like us, who can no longer be “Reichsfreunde”, because we don’t have a “Reich” and don’t ask the Count for more than approved space for a small and quiet community, which--has not yet lost all ideals.</span></p>
