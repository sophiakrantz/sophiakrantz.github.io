    <p><span class="hide">But the Jews, I shall be told, are incapable of being reformed, because they are absolutely worthless. I reply, that we see few of them commit murder, or other enormous crimes, that call forth </span>public vengeance<span class="hide">; but their abominable meanness produces base actions. Mr Michaelis assures us, that in Germany, of twenty-five criminals imprisoned or condemned, twenty-four are always Jews. This is the assertion of Mr. Michaelis--but, in the first place, an assertion </span>is no proof<span class="hide">. The truth of this, however, might have been easily ascertained, by examining and producing the </span>criminals<span class="hide">. Secondly, supposing the circumstances to be as true as it is doubtful, this </span>would prove nothing but<span class="hide"> against the German Jews; and lastly, it would still be necessary to establish as a certainty </span>that<span class="hide"> this perversity proceeds immediately from their religion, or their natural disposition. That it is not inspired by </span>the law<span class="hide">, is evident; shall we believe, then, that it </span>is<span class="hide"> innate? Some peevish philosophers, indeed, have </span>pretend<span class="hide">ed, that man is born wicked; but happily for the honor and comfort of humanity, this system has been banished to the class of absurd and mortifying hypotheses. </span>So many laws made against the Jews,<span class="hide"> always suppose in them a natural and indelible worthlessness; but these laws, which are the fruit of hatred or prejudice, have no other foundation </span>but the motive which gives rise to them<span class="hide">. This perversity </span>is not so<span class="hide"> inherent in their character as to affect every individual. We see talents and virtues shine forth in them wherever they begin to be treated as men, especially in the territories of the Pope, which have so long been their terrestrial paradise; in Holland, Prussia, and even among us. Hertz and Bloch render the Jewish nation illustrious at present in Germany; and the Hague is honored by a Pinto. We must, therefore, believe these people susceptible of morality, until we are shown, that they have invincible obstacles in their physical organization, and in their religious and </span>moral<span class="hide"> consittution.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Let us cherish morality, but let us </span>not<span class="hide"> be </span>so<span class="hide"> un</span>reasonable<span class="hide"> as to require it of those whom we have compelled to become vicious. Let us reform their education, to reform their hearts; it has long been observed, that they are men as well as we, and they are so before they are Jews.</span></p>
    <p><span class="hide">Mr. Michaelis objects also, that this nation being in constant opposition to general manners, will never become patriotic. We allow that it will be difficult to incorporate them into universal society; but between difficulty and impossibility, there is the same difference as between impossibility and possibility. I have myself remarked, and even proved, that hitherto the Jews have been invariable in their manners and customs; </span>but<span class="hide"> the greater part of their customs are not </span>contrary to civil functions<span class="hide">; and with regard to those which may appear to be incompatible with the duties of the citizen, they are preserved only by the uniformity of the conduct, which all nations observe towards them.</span></p>
