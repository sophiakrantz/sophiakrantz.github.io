    <!-- <p>The Jewish people are largely descended from the Hebrew tribe of Judah and the name "Jew" is derived from the Hebrew word "Yehudi", meaning "of Judah". Jewish people are commonly referred to as "Semites", owing tom their geneological connection to the Biblical Shem, though the phrase "Semitic peoples" refers to various groups rather than just Jews; it is for this reason that "anti-Semitism" is a misnomer, though it is equated with anti-Jewish rhetoric and thought.</p>
    <p>The Jewish people have been persecuted for generations, and modern anti-Semitism rises on the back of centuries of anti-Jewish rhetoric and prejudice, amalgamating into the everyday hatred that Jewish people face in their professional and personal lives.</p> -->
    <p>The purpose of this website is to create a resource for critically examining anti-Semitic writing and rhetoric over time, as a means of understanding how it developed and has played a role in general society and popular culture. An additional goal of this website is to understand how the common themes of alienating and villainizing a minority group are played out on different people even to this day. I hope that in reading and analyzing some of the truth and the lies behind these writings people will be able to understand patterns in hate speech and be able to identify and stand up against them.</p>
