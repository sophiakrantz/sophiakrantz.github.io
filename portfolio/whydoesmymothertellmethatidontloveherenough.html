					<i>Why Does My Mother Tell Me That I Don't Love Her Enough?</i> is a digital self-help book that chronicles the experience of recognizing emotionally abusive relationshps between an individual and their mother. This project was developed as part of my research for my thesis project <a href="https://sophiakrantz.github.io/book/" target="_blank">The Misadventures of Mother and Me</a> but stands on its own as a way of approaching these relationships through an academic lens rather than an emotional one. Although only several spreads long, the book contains an amalgamation of emotional abuse trauma stages that I developed from outside research, complete with advice on coping and graphics to accompany it.
